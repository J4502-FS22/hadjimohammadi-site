              <p>Alcatraz Island is an infamous prison in San Francisco that is on a small island. You would take the ferry to get to the island and had housed some of the most notorious criminals such as Al Capone and George Kelly. The prison is an attraction now and from the outside gives you a gorgeous view of the city. From the inside, you have a chance to explore what the prison looks like from its intimidating prison cells to its lighthouse, and to its military fort. Being able to visit a maximum security prison that was established in the 1800's is a pretty awesome experience to get to see historically and being able to ride in a ferry on the way there is pretty awesome too .</p>
